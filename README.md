# TOPIC- INDOOR TEMPERATURE AND HUMIDITY PREDICTION.

WORKING- Performed data cleaning, worked on exploratory data analysis, training and testing set and model building.

# GENERAL STEPS TO PREDICT TEMPERATURE:-

1) State the question and determine the required data (completed)

2) Acquire the data

3) Identify and correct missing data points/anomalies

4) Prepare the data for the machine learning model by cleaning/wrangling

5) Establish a baseline model

6) Train the model on the training data

7) Make predictions on the test data

8) Compare predictions to the known test set targets and calculate performance metrics

9) If performance is not satisfactory, adjust the model, acquire more data, or try a different modeling technique

10) Interpret model and report results visually and numerically


The prediction of relative humidity is a challenging task because of its nonlinear nature. The machine learning-based prediction strategies have attained significant attention in tackling a broad class of challenging nonlinear and complex problems. The random forest algorithm is a well-proven machine learning algorithm due to its ease of training and implementation, as it requires minimal preprocessing. The random forest algorithm has hitherto not been employed for estimating air quality parameters, such as relative humidity. In this study, the random forest approach is implemented to estimate the relative humidity as a function

In the first project I predicted the temperature and humidity by replacing the values
* the first step I predicted the temperature based on humidity and other factors such as precipitation, wind speed, etc.
* the second step I predicted humidity based on temperature and other factors like precipitation, wind speed, etc.

In the second project and after a simple research I found that humidity depends on temperature so i did the same work but :
In the first step I removed the humidity column from the table and I predicted the temperature depending on the remaining factors of the table as wind speed, atmospheric pressure... etc.
In the second step, it predicted humidity based on temperature (predicted in the first step), atmospheric pressure and other elements of the table.
And I got the following results.

The following chart shows the idea of the second project :
