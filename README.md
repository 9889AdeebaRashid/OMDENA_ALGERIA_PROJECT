# ACTIVE MEMBERS

ADEEBA RASHID (TEAM LEADER) AND ABDELILLAH.

# TOPIC- INDOOR TEMPERATURE AND HUMIDITY PREDICTION.

WORKING- Performed data cleaning, worked on exploratory data analysis, training and testing set and model building.

#GENERAL STEPS TO PREDICT TEMPERATURE:-

1) State the question and determine the required data (completed)

2) Acquire the data

3) Identify and correct missing data points/anomalies

4) Prepare the data for the machine learning model by cleaning/wrangling

5) Establish a baseline model

6) Train the model on the training data

7) Make predictions on the test data

8) Compare predictions to the known test set targets and calculate performance metrics

9) If performance is not satisfactory, adjust the model, acquire more data, or try a different modeling technique

10) Interpret model and report results visually and numerically
